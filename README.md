# Movie Roulette

Movie Roulette is a great tool to use when you can't figure out which movie to watch. Using a simple interface, you can enter parameters for a movie you'd like to see and "Spin" the movie roulette wheel. I have definitely found some hidden gems (along with hidden not-so-gems) while creating this app.

All you have to do is enter a set of parameters and hit "spin"!

Movie Roulette was built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and is powered by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.
